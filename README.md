First Year Hack - The Fashion Helper App


An app that allows you take a photo of an item of clothing you are wearing and identifies what colour it is. It then searches online within existing colour palettes to find what items can be matched. This app is aimed at people who are trying to diversify their outfits without fear of making any terrible mistakes. There's also an option within the app to log all colours existing within your outfit. This allows you to ensure that you're not wearing too many clashing colours.
